        <p>When starting your lifting journey, prioritize proper form to prevent injuries and maximize results. Begin with lighter weights and master your technique before progressing. Consistency is very important, establish a regular workout routine tailored to your goals. Embrace progressive overload by gradually increasing weights for strength and muscle gains. Prioritize rest and recovery, maintain a balanced diet with protein intake. Make sure to listen to your body and don’t injure yourself.</p>
