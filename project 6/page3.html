        <h2>Notes</h2>

        <p>Start with a weight that challenges you but allows you to complete the recommended reps with good form. As you progress, gradually increase the weight.</p>
        <p>Rest for 60-90 seconds between sets and exercises.</p>
        <p>Ensure you maintain proper form throughout each exercise to prevent injury.</p>
        <p>Aim to perform this workout plan 3 times a week, with a rest day in between each workout day.</p>
        <p>Stay hydrated during your workouts, and consider incorporating core exercises and cardiovascular workouts on your rest days for a well-rounded fitness routine.</p>
